# Bare metal STM32

Develop code for STM32 boards with a very minimal code base.
I've added some of my own examples for the L476RG (cortex m4) board. These are 100% compatible with all platforms. Just
install the following tools for your system.

### <b>Tools</b>

- [arm compiler & debugger](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/embedded/arm-compiler)
- make or [make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- [openocd](http://openocd.org/)

Debian based systems

```console
apt-get install build-essential gcc-arm-none-eabi openocd
```
